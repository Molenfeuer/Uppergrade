## Features

Did you ever feel like all that vertical space in your sheds and basements are going to waste? That you can stuff just about twice as many fruits and vegetables in your kegs and casks if you just made them taller?

Well, things are looking up! Introducing Upper-Grades for your machines, pushing your machines to new heights! This mods adds FOUR brand new crafting recipes, which can DOUBLE the output for the 

- keg
- cask
- preserve jar
- furnace

with a brand new scientific advancements known as 'putting them ontop of each other' and 'making them longer'.

*Note: Due to hardware limitations machines cannot be more than two tiles high, therefore maxxing out the tiles will have to do.*
